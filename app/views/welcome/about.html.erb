					Size

				<p>
					Just how mini are the doughnuts? Our doughnuts are a little less than 2‚Äù in diameter. This makes our doughnuts the <span class="standout">perfect size</span> to be eaten in a single, savory bite.

					Flavors

				<p>
					We have collections of both  <span class="standout">sweet</span> and <span class="standout">savory</span> doughnuts. Our doughnuts are inspired by seasonal flavors and the menu is always changing. Be sure to check out our menu to see our current flavors!

					About the Founders
					<hr>
				</h1>
				<p class="light">
					Founders Stacey Lu (right) and Engeline Gomez (left) met in early 2015 at the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City, where they graduated top of their class. Both career changers, (Engeline comes from a background in business management and marketing, and Stacey has a fine arts degree with experience in the fashion industry), they realized that their true passions lie in food and cooking. After enrolling in culinary school, they fell in love with baking too. The doughnuts they create range from flavors that are sweet to savory, reflecting their love of both culinary and pastry arts.
